MY PERSONALIZED VOICE ASSISTANT

 Project born with the idea of making my first voice assistant. Later evolved into a project that, from the foundations of an assistant created for me, aims to create a unique, irreverent, wise and more funny assistant than the others, with unique and particular features.

 The initial code needs some good refactoring, as it was code that only had to work locally with a few lines of code and that nobody would see. Now, as a public and with future features on the way, it needs it.

 **Improvements to be made**:
   - [x] find a cool name for the assistant
   - [x] refactoring
   - [ ] less spaghetti code
   - [x] creation of audio.py file to separate speech recognition from the rest of the program (src)
   - [x] include all audio files in an "audio" folder
   - [x] add sounds to startup, dice roll and calculations
   - [ ] make the assistant aware of the time and day 
   - [ ] make the initial greeting more special by giving indirect information on the weather
   - [ ] replace the chiacchere.py and dice.py files with json files to be placed in a special "json" folder
   - [ ] think about possible machine learning to make the assistant more sociable
   - [ ] make automatic or more intuitive for others to set the path of the programs to be started by the assistant
   - ...

   - [ ] personalization
   - [x] activation with voice command
